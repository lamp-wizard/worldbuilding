# 1st Mechanized Brigade

## Summary

The 1st Mechanized Brigade is a standard APU brigade that resides in one of the six assault carriers under the control of the VWS, and by association, are members of the VWS and the brigade is run in a republican manner. It is a former Verrusian mechanized brigade, but (almost) the entire unit defected during the VWS revolt. They were allowed to keep their unit number and history as a result of their fighting under the syndicate's banners and have gained full rights as all other workers under the VWS. 

Due to the smaller scope of the revolt in Verrusian space, the Verrus gaunlet that the VWS had to run was much easier than the Gathican gauntlet, and escaped the revolt near full strength.

## Organization

Soldiers tribunals for each tier of rank (volunteer, NCO, Junior Officer/Ensign, Senior Officers) are regulated as a group and all have an equal say, representatively, in how the brigade is run. During combat, the responsibilities still lie on the officers who are in the fighting however the lead and control of the unit (or units) involved in said fight can be taken control of by someone else in the unit that isn't the officer. Officers are also able to be democratically promoted or demoted given the decision of their soldiers. In all, the system of organization is very decentralized
