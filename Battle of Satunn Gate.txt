## Combat Registry

*PRE-COMBAT*

Gathican military forces on the planet and surrounding space of said planet numbered around ~12,000 APU and a nearby fleet due to Satunn being home to a warpgate. Since this is during the six-week stretch of military exercises between Gathican and Lucannus, it is almost at half strength (normally ~21,000) and its fleet sent out 1/3 of its forces to train in the military exercise. It held 12 mechanized APU regiments, a mix of veteran and sophomore units: the 13th, 14th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 68th, 70th, 72nd, 109th, 110th, 111th, 134th. 

Velacian military forces at the time numbered around 4 brigades: the defected 62nd, 115th, 217th, and the 1st, totalling at about ~3,800 APU/pilots, with a sizeable fleet as well.

### Summary

Gathica: ~12,000 APU and accompanying forces (13th, 14th, 20th, 21st, 23rd, 68th, 70th, 72nd, 109th, 110th, 111th, 134th)

Velacia: ~3,800 APU and accompanying forces (1st, 62nd, 115th, 217th)

## Combat

*FIRST CONTACT*

VWS forces race to Satunn from nearby Syn, taking advantage of the military exercises occuring in another system.

The Gathican fleet was on alert due to communication with Syn, but did not quite grasp how big the enemy was nor was it expecting much.

Contact between the two navies started with the VWS Capital ship, *Minded Hand*, charging head-first into Satunn space and nearly colliding with one of the A-class military substations, taking it out of action temporarily and making the commanding officer of the Gathicans, General Tirth, go on the defensive. 

The VWS took an unconventional spin to the combat that broke out in space in order to claim the gate for itself: the *Minded Hand* towed out and deployed several mobile railgun platforms, not bothering to start the fight in space with conventional APU combat. It struck first, and it struck fast: the railguns focused on the APU hangars, giving the ships time to launch the four brigades into space while it kept enemy APUs in their own hangars.

Several APU companies of the 109th were destroyed or put out of action by the railguns themselves as they were hit in their hangars, and another two companies of APU from the 13th were destroyed or put out of action when the railguns took a second wind.

The VWS 62nd unit was the first to fully deploy, and helped attack the opposing naval forces.
